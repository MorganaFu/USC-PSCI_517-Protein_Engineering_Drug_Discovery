**In this course, the following topics are covered:**
1. Basics of Protein Sequence, Structure, and Post-translational Modifications
2. Enzymes: from Catalysis to Therapeutic Applications
3. Experimental Approaches for Analyzing and Characterizing Proteins
4. Monoclonal Antibodies
5. Elastin-like Polypeptides for Drug Delivery
6. Cyclotides
7. Bispecific Antibodies
8. Antibody-Drug Conjugates
9. Fusion Proteins Technologies for Biopharmaceuticals
10. Cytotoxic Fusion Proteins

The final project involves composing a research proposal for the designed drug, following the guidelines outlined in the "Proposal Writing Outline." AlphaFold2 was utilized to predict the structure of the designed antibody. The script for running AlphaFold2 on USC CARC, along with the generated PDB files, is included in the AlphaFold2 Protein Structure Prediction folder.
